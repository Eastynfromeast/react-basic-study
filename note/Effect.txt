# useState

  Sometimes, you want to be able run some code only on the first render 
    ex. get the data from API
  
    How useEffect works
      function useEffect(effect: EffectCallback, deps?: DependencyList)
      useEffect(function, [array? ]);
      execute some codes only when some specific state changes
  useEffect(() => {
		console.log("SEARCH FOR", keyword);
	}, [keyword]); // telling JS plz watching "keyword"

  console.log 가 두번씩 찍히는 이유
    A. In development mode React renders everything twice :) Nothing is wrong with your code.
    this is only for development mode. useEffect will not be called twice in production, only when we are on `localhost`

    useEffect runs a function when the props change, or only at the start or end of the component's lifecycle.
