# State
    State? data that changes

connect to the variable by curly bracket 
need to refresh the UI == rerendering == show a new version of Container

render()? weird way of rerendering UI

Power of React!
    Vanilla JS changes the whole,
    React updates only the differences!

modify the data and render AGAIN
the best way to automatically trigger rerender

console.log(data); // receive an array => [value, function]
const food = ["pizza","tomato"];
const [myFav, secondFav] = food;
[data, setData] data name you want to change and new value of the data

useState() <- automatically trigger RE-RENDER
